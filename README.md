## Build steps

First, we need to compile the elm code.

```bash
$ make build
```

This command compiles the elm code and puts the produced
javascript in `site/js/`.  You can run the code by opening up
`site/index.html` in the browser.

## Hacking

When doing developement, you may want to run this project in
elm-reactor.
